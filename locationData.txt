A residential area with quaint homes, leafy roads, markets and temples, a walk here can take you back in time. Always buzzing with activity, Basavanagudi buzzes even more feverishly before festivals. There are numerous restaurants here, some institutions in themselves. This is a good place to feast on idlis (savory cake), dosas (savory pancakes) and the famous filter kaapi (coffee)."},{"name":"Malleswaram","longitude":"77.564292799999980000","latitude":"13.003062400000000000","description":"Malleswaram, that bastion of Tamilians in Bangalore, is another locale that is a whole world away from India\u2019s silicon city. Watch maamis in their kanjeevarams haggle in the market, visit a temple or two, eat local food and browse through small shops. The Kaadu Malleswara Temple and Sankey Tank are oases of calm amid the bustle.
